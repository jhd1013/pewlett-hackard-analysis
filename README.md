## Summary
- 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins to make an impact
- Assuming a single mentor can take on up to 3 mentees while still being an effective mentor, at least 30,000 of those eligible for retirementn would need to also be eligible for the mentorship program.  This analysis shows that only 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program.  Based on these considerations, there are not enough mentors available to mentor the next generation of PH employees.
